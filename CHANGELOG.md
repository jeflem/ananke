# Changelog

## Next release

* Fixed typos and broken links in doc.
* Update all packages:
  * JupyterHub 4.0.4 (as before)
  * JupyterLab 4.0.7 (was 4.0.4)
  * Nbgrader 0.9.1 (as before)
  * Notebook 7.0.6 (was 7.0.2)
  * Python 3.11.6 (was 3.11.4)
* Change to JupyterHub's LTI config due to a bug in LTIAuthenticator/Traitlets (see [GitHub issue](https://github.com/jupyterhub/ltiauthenticator/issues/177) for details). **Maybe you have to modifiy your `30_lms.conf`. The value for `c.LTI13Authenticator.client_id` now always has to be a list!**
* Use [`nb_conda_kernels`](https://github.com/Anaconda-Platform/nb_conda_kernels) for kernel management. Commands for creating/cloning/removing local conda environments have slightly changed, see hub users doc.
* Add install scripts for optional features (base packages, MyST markdown rendering, WebDAV support, real-time collaboration).
* Simplify configuration of collaboration rooms.

## Ananke 0.2

* Do not use LMS course title for creating nbgrader course ID. This allows to modify LMS course title without having to recreate the course for nbgrader. **Breaks courses created with Ananke 0.1** (undefined/untested behavior).
* Update developer doc (release procedure).
* Do not show formgrader services in hub control panel services drop down.

## Ananke 0.1

The first Ananke release.
